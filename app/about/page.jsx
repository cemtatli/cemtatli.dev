          I graduated from Izmir Democracy University Management Information Systems department in
          2022. During my university life, I took part in projects in multiple languages (Python,
          MySQL, PHP (Joomla), Flutter, Kotlin). My university graduation project was Web3 virtual
          wallet integrated NFT marketplace interface. I'm currently dealing with interface
          development. <br /> <br /> I develop projects with a mobile-first approach based on
          technologies such as JavaScript, React, NextJS, Tailwind CSS, SASS, which focus on
          responsive design. I am someone who is interested in technological developments and always
          strives to improve myself. The frontend development world is changing rapidly and I am
          constantly trying to improve myself to be aware of these changes.
          <br /> <br /> I constantly strive to learn new technologies, follow best practices and the
          latest trends. I also feel confident in teamwork, fast learning and strategy development
          based on my previous projects.
